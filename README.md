Signal processing
Author: Pengkun Zhang

The objective of this project is to design filters to remove interference and noise from an ECG signal.

This project utilizes signal processing toolbox in matlab to filter the noisy ECG signal and calculate the average heart beat and average heart beat variability of the sampled signal.

The file contains data of a recorded ECG signal which was sampled at fs = 250 samples/sec.
